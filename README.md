# WhatsApp@me

A full-stack modern messaging application inspired by WhatsApp, with powerful features that go beyond WhatsApp Web. Built using the latest technologies like Next.js, Clerk, Convex, and ZEGOCLOUD, this clone provides real-time chat, video calls, group management, and a fully responsive interface that works flawlessly across devices.
